# Skills and Resources Audit
## Project Summary
To develop software that can assist in applying Optical Character Recognition in relation to our curated PDFs which are all data tables - that have been identified from trawling through many millions of pages of archive documentation, in order to transfer the data from PDF pages into a useable .csv format.

## Technical Skills Required
This project will require experience in programming with python and potentially other languages such as HTML depending on the needs of the client for a web interface. Success in this project will rely heavily on the application of optical character recognition (OCR) libraries, therefore it is essential team members research and learn about OCR libraries in python to ensure our software can accurately apply OCR technology. It will be useful for team members to understand how to use APIs and other external libraries which may come in useful such as image enhancement libraries so images can be pre-processed before being processed by OCR. Due to a wide range of quality in the PDF documents that have been curated it will also be important our team to have skills in image enhancement and increasing the quality of images to ensure we can successfully transfer data from the PDFs to csv. Skills in testing frameworks such as PyTest will be important to ensure our project works as expected.

## Non-Technical Skills Required
Project management is essential to be able to deliver a successful project to our client, therefore, it is important that team members have an understanding of project management techniques that they can apply throughout the project. Our team will also operate in an agile/scrum methodology and deliver sprints to the client throughout the semester. Many of our team members have experience using an agile methodology from units such as Agile Web Development. It is also important that our project is clearly documented for non-technical and technical users so that we produce a usable and maintainable system for the client.

## Tools and Resources Required for the Project
Programming languages: python
<br>Libraries/frameworks: Tesseract, Pillow, OpenCV, etc.
<br>Testing tools: PyTest
<br>Version control: Git/Github
<br>Other tools/resources: CITS3200 unit page, CI/CD, Visio, Figma, IDEs.
